### Module 1: Hello, Python!

I started by exploring the basics of **Python programming**. I learned to use **Jupyter Notebooks**, which provide an interactive environment for coding and data work. This module also introduced me to using **variables** and different **data types** to organize data and practice fundamental coding skills.

### Module 2: Functions and Conditional Statements

In this module, I learned how to use **functions** to perform specific actions on data. I also discovered how to write **conditional statements** to instruct the computer on how to make decisions. The focus here was on writing clean, readable, and reusable code.

### Module 3: Loops and Strings

This module taught me how to use **loops** to automate repetitive tasks, which is a huge time-saver in data work. I also gained skills in manipulating **strings** using methods like slicing, indexing, and formatting.

### Module 4: Data Structures in Python

I explored fundamental **data structures** in Python, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. The biggest takeaway from this module was learning about two of the most important libraries for data analysis: **NumPy** and **pandas**.

### Module 5: End-of-Course Project: TikTok Claims Classification

For the final project, I applied my Python skills to a real-world problem: preparing a dataset for a machine learning model to classify user submissions as either a "claim" or an "opinion". I performed a **preliminary analysis** of the dataset to understand the relationship between key variables.
